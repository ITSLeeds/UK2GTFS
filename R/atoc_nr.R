#' ATOC to GTFS (Network Rail Version)
#'
#' Convert ATOC CIF files from Network Rail to GTFS
#'
#' @param path_in Character, path to Network Rail ATOC file e.g."C:/input/toc-full.CIF.gz"
#' @param silent Logical, should progress messages be surpressed (default TRUE)
#' @param ncores Numeric, When parallel processing how many cores to use
#'   (default 1)
#' @param locations where to get tiploc locations (see details)
#' @param agency where to get agency.txt (see details)
#' @param shapes Logical, should shapes.txt be generated (default FALSE)
#' @param working_timetable Logical, should WTT times be used instead of public times (default FALSE)
#' @param public_only Logical, only return calls/services that are for public passenger pickup/set down (default TRUE)
#' @family main
#' @return A gtfs list
#'
#' @details Locations
#'
#' The .msn file contains the physical locations of stations and other TIPLOC
#' codes (e.g. junctions). However, the quality of the locations is often poor
#' only accurate to about 1km and occasionally very wrong. Therefore, the
#' UK2GTFS package contains an internal dataset of the TIPLOC locations with
#' better location accuracy, which are used by default.
#'
#' However you can also specify `locations = "file"` to use the TIPLOC locations
#' in the ATOC data or provide an SF data frame of your own.
#'
#' Agency
#'
#' The ATOC files do not contain the necessary information to build the
#' agency.txt file. Therefore this data is provided with the package. You can
#' also pass your own data frame of agency information.
