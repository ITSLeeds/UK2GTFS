Clean simple errors from GTFS files

Task done:

0. Remove stops with no coordinates
1. Remove stops with no location information
2. Remove trips with less than two stops
3. Remove stops that are never used
4. Replace missing agency names with "MISSINGAGENCY"
5. If service is not public and public_only=TRUE then remove it (freight, 'trips' aka charters)
       (these have a null route_type, so loading into OpenTripPlanner fails if these are present)
}
